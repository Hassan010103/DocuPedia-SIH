    "faqs": {
      "q1": "How do I upload a document?",
      "a1": "You can upload documents by either dragging and dropping them onto the designated area on the Dashboard or by clicking the \"click to browse\" link to open your file explorer and select files manually. The system supports multiple file uploads at once.",
      "q2": "What file types are supported for AI summarization?",
      "a2": "Our AI summarization currently works best with text-based documents like PDF and DOCX. For image files like JPG or PNG, the AI generates a summary based on the filename. We are actively working on expanding our OCR capabilities to summarize text within images.",
      "q3": "How long does it take to generate an AI summary?",
      "a3": "Summary generation is typically very fast, often completing within 5-10 seconds. For very large or complex documents, it may take slightly longer. You will see a \"Generating...\" status next to the document while the process is ongoing.",
      "q4": "Can I re-summarize a document?",
      "a4": "Yes. If a summary fails or you believe a better one can be generated, you can click the \"Re-summarize\" button in the document list. This will send a new request to the AI to generate a new summary for that file.",
      "q5": "How do I share a document with my team?",
      "a5": "From the document list on either the Dashboard or the Documents page, click the \"Share\" button on the desired document. This will open a dialog where you can select team members or entire teams, set permissions (e.g., view or edit), and send a notification.",
      "q6": "Is there a version history for documents?",
      "a6": "Version history is a planned feature and is currently in development. Soon, you will be able to view and revert to previous versions of your documents, providing a complete audit trail of all changes.",
      "q7": "Can I access my documents on a mobile device?",
      "a7": "The application is fully responsive and accessible through any modern web browser on your mobile device or tablet. A dedicated native mobile app is on our future roadmap.",
      "q8": "What security measures are in place to protect our data?",
      "a8": "We take data security very seriously. All documents are encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. Access controls are strictly enforced, and our infrastructure undergoes regular security audits to ensure compliance and protection against threats.",
      "q9": "Where can I see my storage usage?",
      "a9": "Your current storage usage is displayed on the Dashboard in the \"Storage Used\" card. More detailed storage analytics, including usage by file type and date, can be found on the Analytics page.",
      "q10": "How does the search functionality work?",
      "a10": "The search bar in the header allows you to perform a global search across all documents, teams, and reports. It indexes document names, AI-generated summaries, and metadata to provide fast and relevant results.",
      "q11": "Can I create teams and manage permissions?",
      "a11": "Yes, administrators can create teams and manage user roles from the \"Teams\" and \"Settings\" pages. You can assign users to different teams and define granular permissions for document access, ensuring that users can only see the information relevant to them."
